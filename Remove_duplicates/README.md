# REMOVING DUPLICATES

## Problem statement

Three header files has to be created that contains primitives for array based implimentation of list and pointer based implementation of list and the source file should have the
code to remove duplicates from a given list input by user.

> Header 1 -> Array implementation of list. (Takes index of array to do operations like insertion deletion, retrieve etc.)

> Header 2 -> Previous pointer implementation of list. (Takes previous pointer of linked list node as input to do operations like deletion, insertion, retrieve etc.)

> Header 3 -> Current pointer implementation of list. (Takes current pointer of linked list node as input to do operations like deletion, insertion, retrieve etc.)

> Source -> Code to remove duplicates using any one of header such that the code should run if I change only the header file at the beginning of code.

## Functions inside each header

> INSERT - Takes a data and its location as input and stores data in the respective list.

> DELET - Takes a location and list address as input and deletes the given location.

> RETRIEVE - Takes a location and list address and outputs the value in the location. 

> EMPTY - Checks if the given list is empty.

> INITIALISE_LIST - Initialises the list and its variables.

> INITIALISE_POS - Takes a list pointer as input and initialises it to the beginning of list.

> NEXT_POS - REturns back the next postion of a given position in the list.

> CHANGE_POS - Initialise the pointer input to end of list or the last node.

## How to use

>Download the cpp file and header file.

>Uncomment the header file you want to use in beginning of source code and comment rest 2 header files.

>Compile it using gcc

>run the exe file created.

>Just follow the instructions prompted in command window during running and you are good to go
